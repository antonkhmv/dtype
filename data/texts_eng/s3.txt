First of all, what is a yeti? Himalayan people say there are two sorts of yeti. Both are big — about two metres high — and both can walk on two legs. One (the smaller yeti) eats humans !!! But the larger yeti prefers yaks (similar to big black hairy cows). The yeti doesn’t live in the snow, but in the thick Himalayan forest. It goes to snowy regions to eat a plant which contains salt.
That is the legend. It is easy to say that the yeti is no more than a legend. However, people have discovered other evidence.
In 1951, British mountaineers found footprints in the snow on Mount Everest, at a height of 6000 metres. These footprints were about 28 cms. long. They showed five toes. The footprints were made by a large creature, weighing at least 100 kilograms. No human or animal has footprints like these.
SO what is a yeti — if it exists? Some people think it is like a Giganto-Pithecus, a prehistoric animal that lived in China and India about half a million years ago. Did this animal go into the mountains, when man appeared?
We still do not know the answer. Chris Bonnington’s expedition did not find a yeti; but one member of the group thought he saw one. The expedition found some large footprints in the snow. Then they found the skins of two sheep. Someone — or something — had killed the sheep, then skinned them very well, with a tool. And one day, the expedition lost two pairs of ski poles. They had left the poles under a rock. When they returned, the poles weren't there! No-one else was in that part of the mountains. Indeed, no-one else had visited that region this year. So who had taken the poles? A yeti?
Is this enough to prove that the yeti exists?
