a flock across the window gone when i look around
until the sun gets longer they're getting out of town
where on earth do they go do their feathers freeze stiff
in the snow how should I know but i can bet you they'll come
back to the same old tree since i was crawling they've been
watching over me in the gardens that ripple in the water
flying higher up where nobody sees look at the sky and spot the green
and i heard that they weren't meat to stay anywhere the air chokes
or they get on the flyway so ride the rising current
i trust that i will see you again when i pick up the courage
i hope that i can join you someday
